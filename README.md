# Autonomous-Cockroach-Detecting-Python-Algorithm
In sixth grade, I experimented to determine if cockroaches can overcome their fear of light. Though it took months to analyze all 24000 images taken, I was thrilled to discover that once one roach ventured into the light, others quickly learned from its example.

This tedious image analysis process inspired me to delve into my next research problem: the inefficiency of image analysis. To address this issue, the next year, in seventh grade, I wrote an algorithm that automatically detected roaches by subtracting each image from its previous image to detect large changes caused by a roach's entrance. What had taken me months of late nights amazingly took this algorithm mere seconds.
